# Hackthon Wine

## Introduction 

This hackathon is organised by Ubiqum coding academy. The principle of this hackathon is the following:
* Training data en test data is made available at 09:00
* At 5:30 pm predictions must be delivered
* Accuracy will be the metric used to rank the applications
* Work on your own. Google and literature are allowed.

## Description

This dataset deals with our favourite beverage: wine.
It is about a white variant of the Portuguese "Vinho Verde".
Vinho verde is a unique product from the Minho (northwest) region of Portugal. 
Medium in alcohol, it is particularly appreciated due to its freshness (specially in the summer).

The goal is to model wine quality based on physicochemical tests and sensory data.
There is no data about grape types, brand, selling price, etc.
As the class is ordered, you could choose to do a regression instead of a classification.

## Files 

* Train and test data can be found in the data folder
* The final predictions can be found in the file "final_pred.csv"
* The code for the analysis can be found in the file called "main.R"
